# Super Mario Maker: Super-Komaedamaker-World

## Maker ID: LYX-0GW-L5G

Ever since drawing imaginary Super Mario levels in a notebook at 8 years old, it was always a dream of mine to actualize all those ideas that I had building up. That dream 
finally came true when Super Mario Maker was first released. The possibilities expanded even further in Super Mario Maker 2, especially with its revolutionary super world feature. 
Inspired by the release of this feature, I set out, determined as ever, to create a full-sized Super Mario game, or at least something close to it.

Around 2-3 years of building and testing later, I had a game that I was thoroughly proud of. Through this process, I learned a lot about how to engage a player into your world 
and make it feel worth exploring. I am grateful for this resource that Nintendo provided, for both old and new fans alike, to exercise their creativity in a welcoming yet 
intricately complex environment such as Super Mario Maker. If you're interested in playing through my super world, I left my Maker ID in the beginning of this readme and some 
preview pictures below. Thank you for playing my game.
